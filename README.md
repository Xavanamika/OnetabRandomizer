# OneTab Link Randomizer
App for getting through thousands of my tabs in OneTab browser extension exported file, that shows only 5 random tabs in a terminal. When choosed any tab, it removes from the file, and gets copied to clipboard to be pasted in the browser. Really great tool in finding gems in forgotten tabs. Yeah its not very automated, Im still thinking on connecting it to a main file of the extension, and opening links in the browser automatically. Currently its kind of messy to use...

### Method of using.
> Not automated. Planned to change in future.
1) Create file Recs.txt
2) Open the OneTab extension
3) Open Export mode and copy all of the content to Recs.txt
4) Enjoy using the app...
5) Before adding new tabs into extension, sync versions manually:
	1) Delete all the tabs in the extension
	2) Go to Import mode
	3) Copy all the contents of Recs.txt into import
	4) Save it.
	5) Sync done! Congrats!

Yeah this is kind of very stupid. I really must make all of that automated.
